# Research Interests

My research interest are at the intersection between physics and computer science. 
The group of Professor Hong Guo is famous for its significant contributions in computational condensed matter physics. 
I am still working on finding my specific Ph.D subject. I am exploring problems relating quantum field theory, condensed matter physics, high-energy physics and machine learning.
