# Introduction

I am a french physics researcher. I moved to Montreal for my undergraduate studies. 
In December 2023, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science majoring in Physics minoring in Computer Science from McGill University. 

After graduation, I interned at the [Kasler Brossel Laboratory](https://www.lkb.upmc.fr/) in the [Quantum Fluid of Light](https://www.quentinglorieux.fr/) group under the supervison by Professor Quentin Glorieux in Paris, France. I developped a machine learning tool to better characterize quantum fluids in hot atomic vapor.

I am now back in Montreal for my graduate studies. I am a Ph.D candidate in Theoretical Physics in the research group of Professor Hong Guo ([Lab](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~guo/)) at McGill University. 

Here is my [CV](./media/CV.pdf).
