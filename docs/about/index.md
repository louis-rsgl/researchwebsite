# Introduction

I am a Ph.D candidate in Theoretical Physics in the research group of Professor Hong Guo ([Lab](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~guo/)) at McGill University. In December 2023, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science majoring in Physics minoring in Computer Science from McGill University.

I come from France. I moved to Montreal for my undergraduate studies. I really enjoy the city and its outskirts.
