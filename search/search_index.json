I moved to Montreal for my undergraduate studies.  In December 2023, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science majoring in Physics minoring in Computer Science from McGill University. </p> <p>After graduation, I interned at the Kasler Brossel Laboratory in the Quantum Fluid of Light group under the supervison by Professor Quentin Glorieux in Paris, France. I developped a machine learning tool to better characterize quantum fluids in hot atomic vapor.</p> <p>I am now back in Montreal for my graduate studies. I am a Ph.D candidate in Theoretical Physics in the research group of Professor Hong Guo (Lab) at McGill University. </p> <p>Here is my CV.</p>"},{"location":"about/#other-interests","title":"Other Interests","text":"<p>On the side, I am enjoy running.
